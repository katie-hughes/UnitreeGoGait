## Python Testing

* `bezier.py`: This plots Bezier curves from a series of command points.
* `gait.py`: This was a way of plotting my inverse kinematics functions in order to test their reliability
* `pd_controls.py`: This was a way of visualizing the error in the standup procedure with different motor PD gains
* `plotCurve.py`: This was a way of plotting the commanded foot position over time generated by my ROS node in order to make sure the position was reasonable. It reads from logger statements that are pasted into `myCurve.txt`
* `analyze_high_state.py`: This was a way of visualizing the motor states when the dog stood up in high level mode. It reads from `high_stand_sit.txt` which was the output of a `ros2 topic echo`.
